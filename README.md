# NovaEngine
Friday Night Funkin but it has control over your window manager and it uses electron and it is 99.9% plugin certified

# Disclaimer
> im going to rewrite this when ill make the plugin system and ill make a proper wiki later
this #SSShitstorm code is made by entierly 1 person and no one else **in javascript** and **electron** so the engine will be heavy when packaged, with a good side being... that mods will not require you to install a """CuStOm PaCkEd""" Psych or Codename and will just include plugin links and the bare mod itself.

Planned features?
- Full control over your Window Manager
- Unlimited plugins but no games without them
- You can remove a plugin without 2890 errors

When?
# Never. Probably. This takes a lot of time and fucking effort as im doing the engine from scratch
while others just PROBABLY use haxe and git clone whatever the fnf repo is if theres any.

**Im not proposing this engine as your full on solution to all of the problems**, this project is very ambigious but without any support (KHM KHM https://true1ann.me) i will burn out frequently just like with other stuff, but eventually the engine WILL be done

oh right expect this repository to vanish to my own git whenever THAT will be done, or, on codeberg, i dunno yet

have fun
